## Quick Summary

After a lot of time looking at different topics, I chose to focus on the topic of Squash. I am an avid squash player and have gotten hurt a few times so I researched papers on the effect of injuries and which injuries are most common. I landed on [this website.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228485158_Sport_injuries_in_squash) 

## Analyze and Question the Data

Squash is a very tough sport that requires agile movement and quick reaction time, therefore yielding a lot of injury. In this study, 52 people - 18 competitive males, 23 amateur males, 11 competitive females - were tested. Data of their injury history for two years prior from the release of the article was collected and results were found. The way that data was found was through a questionaire. Within the time frame, the subjects wrote all injuries that they have faced from the sport. Personally, it would be difficult to write all of the injuries, because 2 years is a large portion with how much I play weekly, so I believe the same would go for the professionals. Therefore, the minor injuries probably wouldn't be as represented for the professionals than the non-professionals. They tested many different injuries and there are a couple of questions that I have for the data. Firstly, I do not see a purpose in asking for the education of the subject; it is useless to the findings. Also, there might be some confounding factors, for example, some people have underyling conditions that hinder their movement, but they could write that they suffer from it in the questionaire. Overall, the idea of using a questionaire for the data doesn't seem like the most accurate. Finally, the data was taken in Iran with only 52 subjects, which is a very small sample size for the entire population. Although you are able to say that within the sample LBP is the most frequent injury, the sample is way too small to make any further claims. 

## Analyze the Results

 In this study, 52 people - 18 competitive males, 23 amateur males, 11 competitive females - were tested. It shows that out of all injuries, Lower Back Pain is the most common with 36.5 percent of the population writing it down. The closest other injuries include Tennis Elbow, Muscle Strains and racket and ball kicking with percentages of 21, 19, 19 and 12, respectively. This conclusion seems correct as the sport is very difficult on the lower body with a lot of force acting on it when bending down for a drop shot or lunging for a shot from the back. There is a confouding factor that I can think of which is age. The age range was very different for the 3 groups of people tests, where the mean + or - standard deviation for untrained males was 37.6 plus or minus 11.4 which is much larger than trained males which is 29.1 plus or minus 13.3. Therefore, age could be a burden on some people's movement which could cause the injury more so than the actual sport. I understand that ultimately the sport is what causes it, but the age is primarly the reason. Also, it makes sense that ball and racquet kicking is most common for unprofessionals as it is more of a beginner's mistake and the more heavy duty injuries are with the professionals as they put more time into the sport. Overall, the data makes sense to me and it seems correct, but it is very dfficult to make claims about it with the small sample and confounding variables. 
I do not fully trust the findings of the paper. It is relying on the memory of 52 individuals, which is often not fully correct, and further, the age range is different and it is unrepresenative of the whole population. That being said, I do think that for the individual sample it could be true if everyone remembers what prior injuries they had in 2 whole years.

## "Publish or Perish"

I do not think this paper has a big effect on "Publish or Perish" because not only is it for a small target audience, but there isn't a big competitive market for news in the field. Also, there isn't a lot of misinformation within and through reading it seems that the finding were not fake. Given that it is much different than the example of the "Replication Crisis" that we watched in the video, I do not believe this article would heavily affect the idea. If it was a bigger market, like tennis for example, it could lead to many negative reactions to the sport especially for people who identify within certain age groups tested in the study.
