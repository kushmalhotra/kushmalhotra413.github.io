## My Cs Experience

After learning from Ms. Colebank in 8th grade at the Allen-Stevenson School, I have fell in love with Math and Computer Science. Finally solving for x after 10 minutes of thinking how to do a problem was the best feeling in the world. And even better, if I had a machine to do it for me, I didn't have to go through all of the labor. In 9th grade, I signed up for Computer Science 1 as a new student at HM because I wanted to try something new and had an absolute blast. Although there wasn't much hard coding, I loved to build machines and program movements. Thereafter, I applied for an internship out of school. The internship was all about linear regression and using java to program to limit the MSE. I was **hooked** from there on and starting learning C++ from [this really cool website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm). I am now in AP Calculus BCH which is really challenging but I have been working hard, and I took AP Statistics last year with Mr. Thompson.

## My Favorite Sport

Since 8th grade, when I joined my friends fantasy football team, I can not stop watching the game. Living in New York I had to pick between the Jets and Giants, and after watching Eli Manning throw a touchdown early in a divional game, the choice was set. For the four years of my high school experience, football was a common topic to talk about with friends and fantasy made it extremely interesting. All of my friends battle it out every year and although I haven't won yet, it has created memories that I will remember forever. Watching and playing football is one of my hobbies that I truly cherish and I know it will keep my friends together when we all go away for college.

## My Future in Art of Data

After some thinking I have writting out in bullet points a couple of things I hope to get out of this class:
* Learn a new language that I can use in the future
* Use statistics into programming
* Try to use some of my own interests into the work we do in this class

I have a passion for coding, but I have only learned new material or done some labs. I hope to learn from Mr. Lee to expand my knowledge and look at data in a different way. Also, learning a new language is going to be so cool, which is a huge benefit of this class as well!
