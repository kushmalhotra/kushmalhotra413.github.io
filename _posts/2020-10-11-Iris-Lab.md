### Which Iris had the Longest Petals?

On average, the Iris Virginica species had the longest petals. Their average is 5.552, whereas Iris Setosa's is 1.464 and Iris Versicolor's is 4.26. 

### Which Iris had the Widest Sepals?

On average, the Iris Setosa species had the widest sepals. Their average is 3.418, whereas Iris Virginica's is 2.9739 and Iris Versicolor's is 2.77. 

### Describe my process

The homework previously assigned from the lab was very challenging for me. I had many syntax errors and I often put a "-" instead of a "_". At first I used quotations around each key in the dictionary and it worked for the homework. I submitted what I had and after a meeting with Mr. Lee I learned my mistakes and fixed all of them. 
I started the lab with just the code for the homework. I realized that I first needed to find the petal length for each Iris species, so I changed the phrasing in the Dictreader to "petal_length" and renamed my dictionary "petal_length". I then assigned each of the lists with the respective species to the empty dictionary petal-length. Then, I gathered a previous function that I created that would find my average.

I used this function to sum up all the numbers in each list and then divide that number by the length of the list, which is the basic definition of an average. This got me the average petal length, and I then used the same function for the average sepal width. Finding the sepal width used the exact same process, except this time I created a new empty dictionary and keys that represented the sepal width of the Iris species. I then copied the DictReader from before and changed the key and dictionary names and then printed the average for each list. Once I figured out how to find the first part of the lab, the second part was much more simple for me.

### Reflection
Doing the lab didn't require as much time as the homework. The only problem that I had was that the print function wasn't working for each of the keys in the respective dictionary. I then talked to Jake Federman about my error and he recommended that I create empty lists initially with each plant species and then add them to the dictionary after. I created the keys "Iris_Setosa_width/length, Iris_Vericolor_width/length, Iris_Virginica_width/length" and then appended the numbers to the list and then added them to the dictionary. This was easy to understand and although I had little syntax errors, I tested the reading files homework with the new structure and it worked. I then used the average function that I had made in a previous homework and printed the average of petal length or sepal width for the respective plant.
The main thing that worked for me was actually understanding what to do and being able to program most of it. The homework was challenging for me, but I really understood it well coming into doing the lab, which really helped. I also remembered that I had an average function for a previous assignment and I used that for this one. Another thing I learned was that after each time that you append, you have to use "-" instead of "_", because it represents the part in the CSV, but you would use "_" when you are referring to the list in the dictionary. I will definitely say that I learned a ton from this lab as far as syntax and I am excited for different ones in the future. The main thing that could have gone better was my syntax and I feel like that is a classic answer to the question, but it is true. But, I am really looking forward to using data and programming to find certain things within it.
