### Which Dataset?

I worked with the dataset on country vaccinations

### Discuss the dataset
#### a. The variables
 Within the entire dataset, the main variables that I looked at were the total vaccinations and daily vaccinations. The most important part was the total vaccinations, because I was very curious in seeing which country had the highest. The daily was an interesting second variable, because I wanted to compare the two to see the effectiveness of each of the countries. Just a brief summary of total vaccinations, the mean was 5.92 x 10^5, and the median was 6.63 x 10^4. Therefore, the data is right skewed, as the mean is greater than the median. As far as the daily vaccinations, the mean is 4.23 x 10^4 and the median is 5.54 x 10 ^3, so again the mean is greater so it is right skewed. 

#### b. Distributions

First, let's start with the total vaccinations. I printed the summary statistics for the column and like a mentioned before, the center/median is 5.54 x 10^3 and it is right skewed. The max is 1.06 x 10^6 and the min is 1, so the range is almost the exact same as the max. Also, in total there were 1367 total counts in the calculations. As far as variability, the standard deviation was 1.11 x 10^5. And like mentioned before, the mean was 4.23 x 10^4. I then printed the summary statistics for daily vaccinations. The total count this time was 962 and the center was ar 6.63 x 10^4 with a right skew as well. The max was 2.05 x 10^7 and the min was 0, so the range is the same as max. Also, as far as variability, the standard deviation was 1.84 x 10^6.

#### c. Relationships between variables

For the summary statistics the main relationship was the skew. It makes a lot of sense though, because the variables are connected. If a country does a lot of daily vaccinations, they will have a large total in total vaccinations. Furthermore, using that idea I noticed a trend pictorially. After I graphed all countries with total vaccinations, I selected the top 6 and graphed a new chart. In the top 6 were China, United States, United kingdom, Israel and United Arab Emirates. China and US were clearly the greatest, but I did not expect such small countries like israel and UAE to be in the top 6. For the daily vaccination top 6, it was the US, China, Turkey, United Kingdom, England, and India. Obviously the main relationship was that US and China were the top 2 in both. But the UK was also top 4. Because UAE and Israel are much smaller countries, they were able to spread out the days to test so they didn't have as large of "daily vaccinations". Whereas, India and Turkey are bigger countries. 

#### d. Visualizations

While doing the lab there were four main vizualizations that I provided. Below are two of the four that I created:

In the first picture are the top 6 countries in terms of Daily Vaccinations. 

![Total Vaccination Top 6](https://imgur.com/a/oDekvAU)

In the second picture are the top 6 countries in terms of Total Vaccinations. 


In total, I began with total vaccinations because it stuck out to me. I then create a chart with all countries in the CSV vs Total vaccinations and then graphed just the top ones (there happened to be 6). I felt like that wasn't enough so I then found another variable, daily vaccinations, and repeated the same procedure. What was fantastic about both is the similarity. The top 2 countries were the same and the skewness was as well. The interconnectedness made the conclusions a lot easier. 

### Conclusions

After a pandemic swept the globe early in 2020, scientists have been working hard in creating a vaccine. Now approved by the FDA, it has been mass produced, and distributed across the globe. Through my calculations, it is a sufficent conclusion to say that both China and the US lead all other countries in terms of both daily vaccinations and total vaccinations. In total, the top 6 in terms of total vaccinations are China, United States, United kingdom, Israel and United Arab Emirates. For daily vaccinations, the top 6 were the US, China, Turkey, United Kingdom, England, and India. A mere speculation for the difference is the size of the country. India and Turkey are much larger so they are able to serve more daily vaccinations. However, in total, it is clear that the US and China are the leaders in both categories and the UK is the only other country to appear twice.
