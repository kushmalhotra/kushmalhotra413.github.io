For this assignment I used [this website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-0948_article).

### Identify a statistical question that you could ask.

Is a cloth mask more effective than a medical mask in preventing the spread of COVID-19 from the surroundings?

### Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?

The population of the sample could be New York State because it is large enough to take a sample frame from and it is an area that has been struck with the infectious disease. We would have the supplies (differnt kinds of masks), so in NY it is a good enough location.

### Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.

A feasible sample frame could be the area of NYC because it is a diverse population with all types of age groups and is still susceptible to COVID-19. Our goal is to find a sample that will determine the effectiveness of different types of masks, and by picking NYC it is large and there are enough people to pick of all ages and gender.


### Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?

We can stratify by age because age can be a confounding factor, so we can split a randomly selected group of individuals (both men and female) into groups. Assuming we have all the supplies necessary, each group will be composed of 20 people and from there we can split the groups into two treatments that I will explain later. Stratifying is the best process to take, because age is a confounding variable and if we split into groups of the same age, we will get better results. Explaining further, it is more tolling for older people to roam around and it is more severe which will hinder the experiment, so further, splitting with age would lead to strong results. Obviously, this is not ethical, because we do not want people to catch COVID, but for the sake of the study we will continue it.


### Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.

Null hypothesis: A cloth mask is not as effective as a medical mask
Alternative hypothesis: A cloth mask is more effective than a medical mask

### Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.

We will have two treatment groups within each group that is stratified by age. The variable is the effectiveness of COVID and one treatment group will wear cloth masks and the other will wear medical masks. The purpose of the treatments is to determine the effectiveness of the variable on each mask type and from there we can determine that within the sample frame which type of mask was more effective. 

### Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.

As mentioned in part 6, treatment one will be with cloth masks and treatment two will wear medical masks. After stratifying by age, we will take a simple random sample of the sample frame to determine the members in each group. We will randomly select them which eliminates a lot of bias; however, we will not force each to follow the experiment. The treatments will roam around NYC where one group will wear cloth masks and the other will wear medical. Then after days of roaming and carrying on with their lives, all groups will reconvene and COVID tests will be taken.

### Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.

We will begin by taking simple random samples for 2 treatments within 4 groups. The groups are 10-20, 21-30, 31-40, and 41-50 year-olds and we will randomly select 20 New yorkers into each group. This is voluntary though because we can not force members to participate, but we can offer some sort of benefit if they do so data is not skewed (still in a perfect world). Then we will randomly assign the 20 people in each group to the two treatments, so in total, we will have 8 treatments with 10 members in each. Then, we will let the members roam for days, where one treatment wears cloth masks, and the other wears medical and then we will wait for the results days later. 

### What biases may come up, and how would you address them?

There are a couple of biases that we have to address. The first bias is the voluntary experiment. Although we planned for random assignments of citizens in NYC, we can not force this experiment on anyone, and especially since this is dealing with a disease many will not participate, but since it is an ideal world we can proceed. The second bias is the idea that this is not ethical. Dealing with the disease is extremely severe and no one would actually participate, so we would only be able to do this in the hypothetical world where we have all supplies. This is not an ethical experiment, but for the sake of the study, we must proceed.
